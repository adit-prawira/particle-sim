# Particle Simulation

This is a simple particle simulation utilising Verlet Algorithm, showcasing a fluid like behavior when contained in a container.

The simulation is using SFML and written in C++, more things will be added to the project such having more

- Container shapes
- Particle gradient color
- Interactivity with particle
- UI to control simulation parameters
- UI to control simulation behavior
